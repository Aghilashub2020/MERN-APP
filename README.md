## #ChatSapce - MERN APP

### Project Description

Our previous project, GhettoGroupo- a project management platform, had everything but a direct communication channel. ChatSpace aims at bridging this gap! ChatSpace is a communication platform where people can join/create channels and share messages with others.

***

### Key Featuers

1. Seamless Authentication: _users can login/logout without password requirements for known accounts in just one click!_

2. Channels: _users can create new channels and communicate with others_

3. Messages: _users can share messages with other users in the channel_

4. EAD Feature: _security feature using Firebase_

***

### Test the project

#### Steps to setup evironment

Initially, make sure you have both npm and node.js installed in your device.
To install all the dependencies, run the following in both the frontend and backend folders.
> npm i

Globally install nodemon using the following command:
> npm install -g nodemon

#### Steps to run the application

Open two terminals for both the frontend and backend at the respective folders and run ```nodemon``` in both the terminals. The react server might take a while to load, but once it's done, you'll see a browser tab open with the application.

Now, signin with your google account, create/join channels and you can share real-time messages!
